# TruchiRrana
## Project Description
TruchiRrana is a Frog shaped robot that facilitates communication between hearing and deaf people.

The main idea behind TruchiRrana is to serve as a bidirectional intermediary for communication between hearing and deaf people, even if they are not in the same room. This is achieved through the frog-like form and behavior of the robot, which moves by jumping.

For example, in a household where there are hearing parents and a deaf child, they can use TruchiRrana to communicate. The parents can speak into the application incorporated in the frog and it will jump to the child's room, displaying the message in sign language on its screen (which is the language the child understands). Conversely, the child can respond by using sign language, which the camera on the robot will capture and process, resulting in audio that the parents can hear.

TruchiRrana provides a unique solution for facilitating communication between hearing and deaf individuals in a convenient and accessible way. This project aims to provide a useful tool for improving communication and reducing barriers for the deaf community.
